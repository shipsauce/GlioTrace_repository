% The GlioTrace framework takes a set of stabilized RGB image stacks and 
% performs cell identification, tracking and classification. The resulting
% cell tracks and labels are used to fit parameters of a Hidden Markov
% model to estimate cell morphological transitions across different cell
% lines. Based on label sequences, the proportions of cells in different states are
% calculated for each stack, and additional single cell statistics are created to
% further map the differences in migration between different morphological
% states. 
%
% Further additional statistics are average pixel movement and increase in GFP as a
% proxy for cell proliferation, measured at stack-level.
%
% A combination of single-cell statistics and stack-level statistics are
% used to estimate dose-dependent drug effects by fitting an LME.
