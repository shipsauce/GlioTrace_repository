function avgSpeed = calculate_cell_speed(x, y, deltaT)
% This function calculates the average speed across a time sequence
% for a single cell or a matrix of cells based on x and y 
% coordinates and time delay.
%
% Input parameters:
%   x       - Vector of x coordinates (1 x time)
%   y       - Vector of y coordinates (1 x time)
%   deltaT  - Time delay between consecutive time points (scalar)
%
% Output parameters:
%   avgSpeed - Average speed of the cell (scalar)
